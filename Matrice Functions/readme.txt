Contains .xml project with useful functions for working with matrices in edgy
Internal documentation is within project
To use in own project, it is recommended only necessary functions are exported (vital functions are listed in third page of project)

Project is large - may take some time to load (should not cause BSoD if saved regularly)

Enjoy!
